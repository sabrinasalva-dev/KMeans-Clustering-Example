# K-Means Clustering Example

This repository contains an example of using the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment data into meaningful groups.

## 📂 Files

- **TUGAS K_Means.xlsx**  
  Includes:
  - Raw input data
  - Step-by-step K-Means calculations (centroid updates, cluster assignments)
  - Charts or plots to visualize clusters (if any)

## 📌 Main Features

- Manual K-Means implementation (using spreadsheet formulas)
- Clear clustering process
- Good for educational purposes and beginners

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `.xlsx` file with Excel or compatible spreadsheet software.
3. Inspect the sheets to understand how clustering is done step by step.

## 🎓 Purpose

This project serves as a basic demonstration of clustering concepts and how to perform K-Means manually before moving on to coding it in Python, R, or other tools.
